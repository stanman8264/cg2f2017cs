This scene demonstrates how to handle inputFocus and systemOverlay event

[InputFocus] When input focus is lost, the application is in the background should hide any input representations such as hands.

[SystemOverlay] When SystemOverlay is presented : SystemOverlay is present. In this case the application should pause while still drawing, avoid drawing near-field graphics so they don't visually fight with the system overlay.
