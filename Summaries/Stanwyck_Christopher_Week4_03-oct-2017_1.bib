 abstract = {The paper presents a novel three-dimensional shape acquisition and reconstruction method based on the well-known Archimedes equality between fluid displacement and the submerged volume. By repeatedly dipping a shape in liquid in different orientations and measuring its volume displacement, we generate the dip transform: a novel volumetric shape representation that characterizes the object's surface. The key feature of our method is that it employs fluid displacements as the shape sensor. Unlike optical sensors, the liquid has no line-of-sight requirements, it penetrates cavities and hidden parts of the object, as well as transparent and glossy materials, thus bypassing all visibility and optical limitations of conventional scanning devices. Our new scanning approach is implemented using a dipping robot arm and a bath of water, via which it measures the water elevation. We show results of reconstructing complex 3D shapes and evaluate the quality of the reconstruction with respect to the number of dips.},
 summary = {3D shape reconstruction is a well-researched field which typically uses lasers to scan objects and create 3D representations.  This method still has drawbacks, such as scanning objects with self-occluding features.  To overcome shortcomings of occlusion, among others, the authors of this paper introduce a novel technique in which objects are dipped into water to perform the 3D reconstruction.  Much like MRI or CT scans, the objects are measured in slices with a fixed step interval.  In this particular case, the water displacement is measured which gives the volume of the particular slice.  The objects are dipped in a multitude of angles to create many slices.  Re-creating the 3D shape from these slices is an underdetermined problem with sparsely filled matrices.  The authors have created a method to solve for these  equations which is deemed efficient and simple, and can re-create the object with high resolution using only 10% of the required angles for full reconstruction.  This technique has been demonstratede to successfully scan the cavities of such objects where laser scanning would fail.  Current shortcomings include the inability to measure "caps"(i.e. trapped water inside object), the slow speed of acquisition due to the mechanical nature and step based measuring requirements, and the requirement that an object must not absorb water.  },
