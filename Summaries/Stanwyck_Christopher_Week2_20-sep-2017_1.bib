 abstract = {Image-based texture mapping is a common way of producing texture maps for geometric models of real-world objects. Although a high-quality texture map can be easily computed for accurate geometry and calibrated cameras, the quality of texture map degrades significantly in the presence of inaccuracies. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel global patch-based optimization system to synthesize the aligned images. Specifically, we use patch-based synthesis to reconstruct a set of photometrically-consistent aligned images by drawing information from the source images. Our optimization system is simple, flexible, and more suitable for correcting large misalignments than other techniques such as local warping. To solve the optimization, we propose a two-step approach which involves patch search and vote, and reconstruction. Experimental results show that our approach can produce high-quality texture maps better than existing techniques for objects scanned by consumer depth cameras such as Intel RealSense. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system can be used for texture editing tasks such as hole-filling and reshuffling as well as multiview camouflage.},
 summary = { Image-based texture mapping is a technique which creates a texture for a real-world object based on a series of input images.  RGB cameras with depth sensors can provide input images with corresponding geometry to create a full model.  Often, these images and geometries contain inaccuracies which create distortions in the resulting texture maps.  The techniques in this paper account for these inaccuracies to produce high quality and plausible textures.  Input images are first synthesized into target images so that corrective processing can occur.  Images are aligned and sampled using a two-step patch-based approach which focuses on completeness and coherence. This means that each image used in the reconstruction is generated based on its similarity to the source image as well as its coherence with other target images.  This approach allows for corrections due to local geometric errors.  The main limitation of this approach is that although the results are often correct errors can occur due to missing semantic information.  Other applications of this work include texture hole-filling and texture re-shuffling.  },
