 abstract = {A number of consumer-grade spherical cameras have recently appeared, enabling affordable monoscopic VR content creation in the form of full 360° X 180° spherical panoramic photos and videos. While monoscopic content is certainly engaging, it fails to leverage a main aspect of VR HMDs, namely stereoscopic display. Recent stereoscopic capture rigs involve placing many cameras in a ring and synthesizing an omni-directional stereo panorama enabling a user to look around to explore the scene in stereo. In this work, we describe a method that takes images from two 360° spherical cameras and synthesizes an omni-directional stereo panorama with stereo in all directions. Our proposed method has a lower equipment cost than camera-ring alternatives, can be assembled with currently available off-the-shelf equipment, and is relatively small and light-weight compared to the alternatives. We validate our method by generating both stills and videos. We have conducted a user study to better understand what kinds of geometric processing are necessary for a pleasant viewing experience. We also discuss several algorithmic variations, each with their own time and quality trade-offs.},
 summary = { Creating 360o stereoscopic panoramic video and photo creating has typically required multiple cameras oriented in a ring.  This paper introduces methods for creating this effect using just 2 3600 cameras placed side by side.  The images from these two cameras are stitched together using several techniques which create a convincing image or video.  Differences between the camera values, changing inter-ocular disparity in horizontal and vertical directions, and geometric alignment are problems solved to create a convincing image.  These techniques lower to costs and requirements of creating 360o stereoscopic media. Camera synchronization and distortions at the seams of the image stitching remain as current limitations in this technique.},
