abstract={Three-dimensional (3D) spatial user interface technologies have the potential to make games more immersive and engaging and thus provide a better user experience. Although technologies such as stereoscopic 3D display, head tracking, and gesture-based control are available for games, it is still unclear how their use affects gameplay and if there are any user performance benefits. The authors have conducted several experiments on these technologies in game environments to understand how they affect gameplay and how we can use them to optimize the gameplay experience. This article presents some of our explorations in this area. We specifically looked at three user interface technologies: stereoscopic 3D, head tracking, and hand-gestural interfaces. We conducted several experiments to understand their role in gaming environments. Our lessons learned from these experiments can serve as a framework for the future explorations of games that utilize 3DUI technologies.}, 
summary={In this paper the authors investigate the usefulness of 3D user interface technologies for gaming.  These include Head Mounted displays with head tracking, stereoscopic 3D viewing, and hand gestured for UI.  They conducted several studies to determine the usefullness of these technologies with subjective and objective metrics.  Overall, they found that 3D UI devices can improve the gaming experience under certain conditions.  The 3D interface must be designed into the game from the beginning and taken into consideration before the game is made.  Expert users may also benefit leff from these interfaces due to the familiarity and skill with additional interface techniques.  It is hypothesised that this technology may bridge the gap between basic and expert users by providing a more natural interface.  In addition, the type of game has an impact on the usefullness.  Games with single tasks/objectives and limited background distraction were much improved with these interfaces.  In summary, the 3D UI elements are useful but must be considered from the beginning of game design with the observed caveats. },
