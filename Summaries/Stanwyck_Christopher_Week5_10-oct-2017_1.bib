 abstract = {Head-mounted displays (HMDs) often cause discomfort and even nausea. Improving comfort is therefore one of the most significant challenges for the design of such systems. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of different HMD display configurations on discomfort. We do this by designing a device to measure human visual behavior and evaluate viewer comfort. In particular, we focus on one known source of discomfort: the vergence-accommodation (VA) conflict. The VA conflict is the difference between accommodative and vergence response. In HMDs the eyes accommodate to a fixed screen distance while they converge to the simulated distance of the object of interest, requiring the viewer to undo the neural coupling between the two responses. Several methods have been proposed to alleviate the VA conflict, including Depth-of-Field (DoF) rendering, focus-adjustable lenses, and monovision. However, no previous work has investigated whether these solutions actually drive accommodation to the distance of the simulated object. If they did, the VA conflict would disappear, and we expect comfort to improve. We design the first device that allows us to measure accommodation in HMDs, and we use it to obtain accommodation measurements and to conduct a discomfort study. The results of the first experiment demonstrate that only the focus-adjustable-lens design drives accommodation effectively, while other solutions do not drive accommodation to the simulated distance and thus do not resolve the VA conflict. The second experiment measures discomfort. The results validate that the focus-adjustable-lens design improves comfort significantly more than the other solutions.},
 summary = {In this paper, the authors investigate one of the causes of discomfort and nausea while using head mounted displays (HMDs).  This cause is the vergence-accommodation conflict (VA).  Discrepancies between the distance at which the two eyes converge for binocular vision and the distance at which they focus on for accommodation are neurally coupled since they are almost always the same distance in real life.  For head mounted displays, there is disparity between the simulated vergence distance and the actual focal distance since the screen is at a fixed near distance from the user.  The authors investigate 3 potential reolutions to this problem.  One is monovision in which each eye is fixed to a certain focal distance in order to widen the range of accommodation.  Another is depth of field renderig with gaze contingeny rendering which creates blur and sharpness based on the simulated distance of the object the user is looking at.  The third is focus adjustable lenses.  The authors also create a device which will objectively measure the accomodation response in a head mounted display.  This device uses an autorefractometer to measure the current level of accommodation in the eye.  Using this device, they measure accommodation as well as conduct a comfort study to see if the VA conflict is resolved by one of these techniques and if that reduces discomfort.  They found that focus adjustable lenses do effectively drive accommodiation and reduce discomfort.  DoF rendering provides a slight benefit to accommodation and comfort.  Mnovision actually reduces accurate accommodation and creates discomfort.  The authors believe that focus adjustable lenses could be used in future HMDs to improve comfort when they are capable of providing the necessary field of view and image quality.  In addition, wavefront sensors may be used in future devices to measure accommodation as the refractometer was far too bulky to use in a real head mounted display.},
