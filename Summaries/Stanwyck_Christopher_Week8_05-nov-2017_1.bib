 abstract = {We present an image downscaling technique capable of appropriately representing high-frequency structured patterns. Our method breaks conventional wisdom in sampling theory---instead of discarding high-frequency information to avoid aliasing, it controls aliasing by remapping such information to the representable range of the downsampled spectrum. The resulting images provide more faithful representations of their original counterparts, retaining visually-important details that would otherwise be lost. Our technique can be used with any resampling method and works for both natural and synthetic images. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a large number of images downscaled in combination with various resampling strategies. By providing an alternative solution for a long-standing problem, our method opens up new possibilities for image processing.},
 summary = {In this paper, the authors introduce a technique for image downsampling which intends to preserve high-frequency features.  Traditional downsampling techniques typically implement a low-pass filtering stage to remove high frequency features in order to limit aliasing artifiacts in the downsampled image.  Rather than filtering out these features, the authors use Fourier and Gabor analysis to remap these high frequencies to the visible spectrum of the downsampled image.  This is performed by creating overlapping patches of the original image and remapping the spectrum of each patch to the visible spectrum and phase aligning the resultant patches.  These new techniques can be used with many existing downsampling techniques to produce images which more faithfully represent the orignal image.  Limitations include the processing speed of the current implementation (not optimized nor parallelized), overemphasizing certain repeating patterns, and subject preference for other downsampling algorithms for artistic reasons. },
