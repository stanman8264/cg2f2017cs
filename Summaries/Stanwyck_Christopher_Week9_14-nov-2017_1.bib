abstract={We propose a concept for a lens attachment that turns a standard DSLR camera and lens into a light field camera. The attachment consists of eight low-resolution, low-quality side cameras arranged around the central high-quality SLR lens. Unlike most existing light field camera architectures, this design provides a high-quality 2D image mode, while simultaneously enabling a new high-quality light field mode with a large camera baseline but little added weight, cost, or bulk compared with the base DSLR camera. From an algorithmic point of view, the high-quality light field mode is made possible by a new light field super-resolution method that first improves the spatial resolution and image quality of the side cameras and then interpolates additional views as needed. At the heart of this process is a super-resolution method that we call iterative PatchAnd Depth-based Synthesis (iPADS), which combines patch-based and depth-based synthesis in a novel fashion. Experimental results obtained for both real captured data and synthetic data confirm that our method achieves substantial improvements in super-resolution for side-view images as well as the high-quality and view-coherent rendering of dense and high-resolution light fields.}, 
summary={With the renewed interest in light field cameras, the authors in this paper seek to introduce a method for creating this type of camera in a cost-effective manner.  Presuming one already owns quality DSLR camera, a light field camera can be created by augmenting the base high-resolution camera with a ring of cheap low-resolution cameras.  This is in contrast to other designs wich include dedicated hardware with multiple sensors, algorithms for using multiple shots of the main lense, and many more algorithms.  The authors claim that their method can produce a high quality depth map and super-resolution image without sacraficing high frequency details like other methods, all while leveraging an already available high performance 2D camera.  Their algorithm consists of using a patch-based method to enhance the low resoltion views with image data from the high resolution camera.  Using mulitple low-resolution cameras in a ring provides a high quality depth map.  This depth information allows synthesizing new high detailed views.  After processing, the information is added back to the image feature dictionary for improved quality with successive iterations.  A quality of light-field cameras, this method allows reconstructing high resolution images with varying focal lengths in post processing steps.  Limitations include the time to execute the algorithm (unoptimized and CPU based), inability to handle major occlusions or defocused blur, and the need to calibrate the camera setup.},
