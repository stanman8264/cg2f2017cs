 abstract = {Rendering explosions with self-illumination is a challenging problem. Explosions contain animated volumetric light sources immersed in animated smoke that cast volumetric shadows, which play an essential role and are expensive to compute. We propose an efficient solution that redefines this problem as rendering with many animated lights by converting the volumetric lighting data into a large number of point lights. Focusing on temporal coherency to avoid flickering in animations, we introduce lighting grid hierarchy for approximating the volumetric illumination at different resolutions. Using this structure we can efficiently approximate the lighting at any point inside or outside of the explosion volume as a mixture of lighting contributions from all levels of the hierarchy. As a result, we are able to capture high-frequency details of local illumination, as well as the potentially strong impact of distant illumination. Most importantly, this hierarchical structure allows us to efficiently precompute volumetric shadows, which substantially accelerates the lighting computation. Finally, we provide a scalable approach for computing the multiple scattering of light within the smoke volume using our lighting grid hierarchy. Temporal coherency is achieved by relying on continuous formulations at all stages of the lighting approximation. We show that our method is efficient and effective approximating the self-illumination of explosions with visually indistinguishable results, as compared to path tracing. We also show that our method can be applied to other problems involving a large number of (animated) point lights.},
 summary = {Self-illuminating explosions are common in visual computer generated entertainment.  However, these features are computationally intense.  Traditional rendering methods suche as the path tracing method can take hours to create a low noise image.  The authors of this paper introduce a new method which uses a lighting grid hierarchy to drastically reduce the compute time down to minutes while maintainng the same, or better, visual fidelity.  The explosion is treated as a volume with many point lights.  These lights are rendered using grids of varying resolutions.  In this way, the computation time can be decreased by reducing the number of lights needed to capture the data.  Fine resolution grids are used to calculate the local illumination while coarse grids are used for distant illumination.  The layers are blended together to avoid flickering effects due to binary decisions.  In additon, this method may be used for general many-lights problems as well as multiple scattering.},
