abstract = "Abstract Mobile audio-guides are currently being used in museums to enhance the visitors’ experience. Over the past few years, some Augmented Reality (AR) solutions have been explored in this context, making it possible to provide augmented visual and sonic stimuli through the use of smartphones. However, the special conditions of museums (e.g. artificial markers cannot be used, small, crowded rooms, etc.) and the limited computational capacity of smartphones mean that there are important restrictions in the use of this technology. In this paper we introduce a novel mobile augmented guide for the Casa Batlló museum (Barcelona, Spain) which is based on a combination of traditional and indirect AR. Through the proposed solution, we further explore the use of indirect AR for the interior of buildings as, at present, this technology is usually used for outdoor environments. The developed application is currently being used by Casa Batlló visitors. Retrieval of user experience shows some of the benefits of the proposed solution and opens the door for other similar solutions in museums.",
summary = "In this paper the authors explor the use of augmented reality (AR) in a museum setting.  The use of AR in museums is challenging due to the occlusions of other museum guests as well as the restriction on tracking markers for AR camera positioning.  The authors instead propose to use indirect AR which has two main benefits.  It allows for AR which is unoccluded and does not require markers.  It also allows the processing to be done offline so that the images can be created in high quality and displayed even on low-end smartphones.  The method uses panoramic still images of the rooms in the museum.  Other objects, such as the original furniture of the museum, are placed in the room using existing AR modeling programs.  The result is a cube map which can be overlayed in the room based on the user's position using bluetooth.  For parts of the museum that allow it, traditional AR is also used.  This is for small objects which require close interaction and will typically be viewed by one person at a time.  The AR in this system also allows for animations.  The user study at the Casa Batello museum show general positive reviews.",
