abstract={In practice, real-world physical workspaces and technological limitations restrict the free and unlimited exploration of an arbitrary large-scale virtual environment. This article provides an overview of the existing approaches and techniques for enlarging the walkable virtual space. The authors specifically focus on the methods that use spatial manipulation for spatial compression because it is one of the most promising, but underexplored methods for nonintrusive user redirection in a limited physical space.}, 
summary={Limitations of physical spaces prevent users from experiencing long distance locomotion in Virtual Reality.  There are several techniques in development to reduce this limiation and expand the free range.  The most basic is to prompt the user to re-orient themselves in the room but this is disruptive and breaks immersion.  Another technique is sense manipulation which aims to manipulate a user's trajectory without them noticing.  Yet another class of techniques involves space manipulation.  Users can be introduced to impossible spaces to create overlapping rooms which saves space. Care must be taken to how the rooms are ajoined as certain types of corridors are better suited to tricking the user.  A study has found that environments can even be re-organized if the user is kept distracted.  A combination of impossible spaces and re-organization is used by the authors in a technique called flexible spaces which is meant to procedurally generate large environments of overlapping and changing rooms.  The limiation of all these techniques is that they still need a sizable room and will be challenged if multiple users are in the room at once.  There is also an inherrent limiation in artistic styles and room sizes.},
