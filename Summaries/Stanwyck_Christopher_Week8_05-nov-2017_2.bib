abstract={This paper presents the results of two cognitive load studies comparing three augmented reality display technologies: spatial augmented reality, the optical see-through Microsoft HoloLens, and the video see-through Samsung Gear VR. In particular, the two experiments focused on isolating the cognitive load cost of receiving instructions for a button-pressing procedural task. The studies employed a self-assessment cognitive load methodology, as well as an additional dual-task cognitive load methodology. The results showed that spatial augmented reality led to increased performance and reduced cognitive load. Additionally, it was discovered that a limited field of view can introduce increased cognitive load requirements. The findings suggest that some of the inherent restrictions of head-mounted displays materialize as increased user cognitive load.}, 
summary={Procedural cognitive tasks may be made easier with the addition of virtual and augmented reality systems.  A comparison of 3 AR techniques versus a traditional monitor is made where subjects are instructed to press buttons in sequence on a dome.  Indicating the correct button is done either through superimposed cues (AR) or via a seperate representation (Monitor).  The study showed that cognitive load as reported by the subjects coorelated with response times.  The AR method of SAR (Spatial AR) which involves using a projector to project information onto real objects, required much less cognitive load than using a monitor for visual cues.  Interestingly, the AR methods of the Microsoft Hololens and Samsung Gear VR were significantly worse than both SAR and the monitor.  An experiment with a smaller reuquired FOV showed improvement in the Hololens case (which had a restricted FOV) which may indicate that head mounted AR techniques may be limited by other intrinsic parameters of the HMD displays such as vergence and accommodation, ocularity, stereoscopy etc.  In conclusion, AR shows promise for reducing cognitive load in extraneous cognitive tasks, however current technologies add other forms of extraneous cognitive load which make them worse than traditional sideband instructional techniques for procedural tasks. },
