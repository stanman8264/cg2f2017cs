 abstract = {Adequate reflectance models are essential for the production of photorealistic images. Microfacet reflectance models predict the appearance of a material at the macroscopic level based on microscopic surface details. They provide a good match with measured reflectance in some cases, but not always. This discrepancy between the behavior predicted by microfacet models and the observed behavior has puzzled researchers for a long time. In this paper, we show that diffraction effects in the micro-geometry provide a plausible explanation. We describe a two-scale reflectance model, separating between geometry details much larger than wavelength and those of size comparable to wavelength. The former model results in the standard Cook-Torrance model. The latter model is responsible for diffraction effects. Diffraction effects at the smaller scale are convolved by the micro-geometry normal distribution. The resulting two-scale model provides a very good approximation to measured reflectances.},
 summary = {Microfacet reflectance models have been widely used to describe macroscopic refletance properties. The most common model is the Cook Torrence model.  However, these models still fail to faithfully reproduce reflectance at grazing angles or with varying wavelengths.  The authors of this paper seek to resolve this conflict by introducing a two level model which incorporates features that are much greater than a wavelength of light (microscopic geometry) and features on the order of a wavelenth of light (nano geometry).  By convolving the reflectance lobe generated by microsocopic geometry with the nanogeometry they were able to create a more faithful reflectance model even with varying wavelengths and grazing light.},
