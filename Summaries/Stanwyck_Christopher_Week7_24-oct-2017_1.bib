 abstract = {Conventional binocular head-mounted displays (HMDs) vary the stimulus to vergence with the information in the picture, while the stimulus to accommodation remains fixed at the apparent distance of the display, as created by the viewing optics. Sustained vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) has been associated with visual discomfort, motivating numerous proposals for delivering near-correct accommodation cues. We introduce focal surface displays to meet this challenge, augmenting conventional HMDs with a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) placed between the display screen and viewing optics. This SLM acts as a dynamic freeform lens, shaping synthesized focal surfaces to conform to the virtual scene geometry. We introduce a framework to decompose target focal stacks and depth maps into one or more pairs of piecewise smooth focal surfaces and underlying display images. We build on recent developments in "optimized blending" to implement a multifocal display that allows the accurate depiction of occluding, semi-transparent, and reflective objects. Practical benefits over prior accommodation-supporting HMDs are demonstrated using a binocular focal surface display employing a liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) phase SLM and an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display.},
 summary = {The vergence-accommodation conflict is a current problem in head-mounted displays for virtual and augmented reality.  This is caused due to the fact that the displays create vergence cues due to stereoscopic displays but fail to address accomodation cues.  Previous technologies to resolve this conflict have been the use of varifocal, multifocal, and light field displays.  This paper introduces multifocal displays.  Each technology has its trade-offs.  Multifocal displays provide the capability to create a per-pixel accomodative focal cue on a per-pixel basis.  This technology uses a phase-only spatial light modulator to create a spatially addressable focus adjustable lense.  Using the diffractive properties of the SLM, the researchers were able to create multiple focal planes to create near-correct image blur at different focal depths.  With just two focal planes, this technique was equal to or better than existing techniques when it comes to accomodation error.  The display prototype was similar in FOV and resolution to existing displays.  The optics for this display are large and bulky however, and more development is needed to make it practical in a commercial display. },
