 abstract = {We present novel designs for virtual and augmented reality near-eye displays based on phase-only holographic projection. Our approach is built on the principles of Fresnel holography and double phase amplitude encoding with additional hardware, phase correction factors, and spatial light modulator encodings to achieve full color, high contrast and low noise holograms with high resolution and true per-pixel focal control. We provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of all holographic computation that integrates with the standard graphics pipeline and enables real-time (?90 Hz) calculation directly or through eye tracked approximations. A unified focus, aberration correction, and vision correction model, along with a user calibration process, accounts for any optical defects between the light source and retina. We use this optical correction ability not only to fix minor aberrations but to enable truly compact, eyeglasses-like displays with wide fields of view (80°) that would be inaccessible through conventional means. All functionality is evaluated across a series of hardware prototypes; we discuss remaining challenges to incorporate all features into a single device. },
summary = {Holographic displays have been researched for decades as the ultimate virtual and augmented reality experience.  High computational costs and conflicting requirements have kept this technology from reaching consumers.  The authors of this paper investigate several areas of holographic displays and create multiple prototypes to show that this technology is becoming more feasible.  They have decided that digital Fresnel holography provides the best solution as it allows software to perform the necessary corrections.  They demonstrate vision correction, multiple focal points, aberration correction, wide FOV, and compact display form factors for near-eye displays.  These calculations are still to challenging for real time displays, but the authors demonstrate that the use of FFT-based convolution using a spatially invariant lens phase function with eye tracked rendering can yield the required performance.   The limitations of the methods are that these technologies have yet to be integrated into a single AR/VR system.},
