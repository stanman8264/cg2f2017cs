abstract={Developing head-mounted displays (HMDs) that offer uncompromised optical pathways to both digital and physical worlds without encumbrance and discomfort confronts many grand challenges, both from technological perspectives and human factors. Among the many challenges, minimizing visual discomfort is one of the key obstacles. One of the key contributing factors to visual discomfort is the lack of the ability to render proper focus cues in HMDs to stimulate natural eye accommodation responses, which leads to the wellknown problem of vergence-accommodation conflict. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of various technical approaches toward enabling focus cues in HMDs for both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications.}, 
summary={This paper provides a survey of the different technologies being researched to resolve the vergence-accommodation conflict.  It describes and analyzes the approaches of Maxwellian View Displays, Vari-focal displays, Multifocal plane displays toward light-field displays, INI-based light-field displays, and computational multilayer light-field displays.  Each of these approaches brings trade-offs.  The types of limitations include low spatial resolution, low contrast, headset bulk, narrow field-of view, unsolved or conflicting focal cues, optical speed, and computational cost.  With the emerging prevalance of HMDs, the author is hopeful that continued research will resolve these conflicts and bring a visually comfortable HMD in the near future.  },
