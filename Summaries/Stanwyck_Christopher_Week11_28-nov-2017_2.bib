abstract={One of the most challenging problems in robot-assisted surgical systems is to provide surgical realism at interactive simulation rates. The proposed visual tracking system can track and register object deformations in real time using a physically based formulation, despite the occlusions produced by the robotic system itself. The results obtained provide an accurate visual representation of the deformed solid and will thus enable new assistance approaches to help surgeons during surgical procedures.}, 
summary={The authors of this article create a system for measuring soft tissue deformation for use with robot assisted surgery.  The method performs offline and online calculations.  Offline calculations involve creating a mesh of the object with keypoints at vertices.  These keypoints are used in the online calculation of the object to measure defomration. The online calculations use a Microsoft Kinect RGBD camera to create a point cloud of the object being deformed.  As it is deformed, distances between the offline and online models are calculated using the keypoints, while discarding keypoints which are within the original bounding box.  This method was demonstrated on several soft tissue samples and produced results within an acceptable margin of error.  Limitations include the error due to occlusions by either the tool, the object being deformed, or the robot.  },
